# Overview

This is a collection of annotated examples of blender functionality.
The files are grouped more or less by the major subject given in the file's
name. Many of the examples come from code I wrote to answer questions on
Blender Stack Exchange, but I didn't think to annotate the code with the
question it relates to. The remainder of the examples are just me
working my way through understanding the specific topic, like the
overly exhaustive demonstration of various Property types.
